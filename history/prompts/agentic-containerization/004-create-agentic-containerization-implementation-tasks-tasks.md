## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation tasks for Agentic Containerization:
- Feature branch: 4a-agentic-containerization
- Created specs/4a-agentic-containerization/tasks.md with 48 actionable tasks
- Organized into 4 phases:
  1. Phase 1: Dockerfile & Base Image Setup (10 tasks)
  2. Phase 2: Docker Compose & Multi-Service Orchestration (12 tasks)
  3. Phase 3: AI-Agent Assisted Build Optimization (14 tasks)
  4. Phase 4: Logging, Monitoring & Cleanup (12 tasks)
- Each task includes: status [x], priority, related feature/module, description, files to create/modify, acceptance criteria
- Task dependencies documented (parallelizable where possible)
- Total scope: 48 tasks for complete agentic containerization implementation

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for AI-agent execution
- 🧪 Tests: null
- 📁 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement (optional)
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are actionable, traceable, and aligned with plan phases

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task validation checklist passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment: null
