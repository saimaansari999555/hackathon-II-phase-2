## Prompt

/sp.tasks

Generate authentication integration tasks from the spec and plan.

Requirements:
- Separate frontend and backend auth tasks clearly
- Organize tasks by phases:
  - Frontend Auth Setup
  - JWT Handling
  - Backend Verification
  - Route Protection
  - Validation & Security
- Each task must include:
  - Task ID
  - Priority (P1 / P2)
  - Clear description
  - Expected file paths
- Ensure no duplication of frontend UI or backend CRUD tasks
- Focus only on authentication and security integration

## Response snapshot

Created authentication integration implementation tasks:
- Feature branch: 3-auth-integration
- Created specs/3-auth-integration/tasks.md with 15 actionable tasks
- Organized into 5 phases:
  1. Frontend Auth Setup (3 tasks)
  2. JWT Handling (2 tasks)
  3. Backend Verification (4 tasks)
  4. Route Protection (3 tasks)
  5. Validation & Security (3 tasks)
- Separated frontend (7 tasks) and backend (8 tasks) clearly
- Each task includes: ID, priority (P1/P2), description, file paths, acceptance criteria
- Dependency chain documented (BE-001竊達E-002竊達E-003竊達E-005竊達E-006)
- Reference to existing frontend UI and backend CRUD specs to avoid duplication
- Implementation order with timeline provided

## Outcome

- 笨 Impact: Complete task breakdown ready for implementation agents
- 洫ｪ Tests: null
- 沒 Files: 1 file created (tasks.md)
- 沐 Next prompts: /sp.implement (invoke auth agents) or manual implementation
- 洫 Reflection: Tasks organized by clear separation of concerns, frontend/backend split avoids confusion

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Task validation checklist passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
