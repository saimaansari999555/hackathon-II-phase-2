## Response snapshot

Created a detailed UI refinement specification for the Mist Green theme applied to the Todo web application.

Scope and intent:
- Specification focused exclusively on visual and UX refinements
- No changes introduced to business logic, API contracts, authentication, or database models
- Existing application functionality preserved as-is

Key areas covered in the specification:
- Elimination of unintended white backgrounds on cards, containers, and footer sections
- Standardization of background colors across all pages to maintain Mist Green consistency
- Improved text, label, and placeholder contrast for better readability
- Clear definition of button colors, hover states, and disabled states
- Mobile navigation bar layout and spacing corrections
- Consistent typography color usage across inputs, forms, and informational text

Design constraints:
- Reuse existing components and layout structure
- Apply changes via styles and theme configuration only
- Ensure accessibility-friendly contrast without altering design identity

Quality review:
- No ambiguous requirements detected
- No clarification markers required
- Specification aligns with existing frontend architecture

Status:
- Specification completed
- Passed internal quality validation
- Ready for planning phase
