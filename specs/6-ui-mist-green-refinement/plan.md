# Mist Green UI – Frontend Plan

## Strategy
Apply a visual-only UI refinement using existing components and layout.

## Steps
1. Review current UI components and pages
2. Define global color tokens and spacing rules
3. Update Navbar styling (theme + consistency)
4. Align Login & Register pages with main theme
5. Refine Task page layout and task cards
6. Update buttons and input fields styling
7. Add subtle hover and focus transitions
8. Verify no logic or API calls were changed

## Constraints
- Do not touch backend
- Do not rename files
- Do not modify routing
- Do not change state or business logic

## Validation
- Manual UI testing on all pages
- Visual comparison before vs after
- Confirm app works exactly as before
